# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project follows Chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning* by Aurélien Géron.

The goal is to build a complete machine learning system, starting from
problem framing and data exploration, through preprocessing, model training,
evaluation, and iteration.

This project emphasizes:
- correct problem formulation
- statistical reasoning
- avoidance of data leakage
- reproducible experiments
