This section corresponds to **Chapter 1** of *Hands-On Machine Learning* by Aurélien Géron.

## Objectives
- Understand what machine learning is and why it is used
- Contrast rule-based systems with learning-based systems
- Visualize learning from data
- Demonstrate overfitting and generalization intuitively

## Contents
