# hands-on-ml-geron

This repository documents my end-to-end journey through machine learning,
starting from statistical foundations and progressing through hands-on
implementations using **Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron**.

## Goals
- Build a deep, principled understanding of machine learning
- Connect statistics to real ML systems
- Create clean, reproducible, and well-explained experiments
- Develop a portfolio suitable for ML Engineer / Data Scientist roles

## Structure
- `01_ml_landscape/` — Core ML concepts and intuition (Géron Chapter 1)
- `utils/` — Reusable helper functions
- Later chapters will be added incrementally

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

This repository prioritizes **understanding over shortcuts**.
